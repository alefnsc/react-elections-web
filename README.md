The React Elections project is a full-stack application designed to retrieve, summarize, calculate, and display election data for users. Its UI/UX elements are responsive and utilize different colors depending on the result. The project was created using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) for backend simulation employing [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server). Due to limited resources on the free plan of Glitch, a loading component is implemented until the service is ready and data is fetched. The frontend leverages React, utilizing useState and useEffect hooks, tailwind, and axios for data fetching.
